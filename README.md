# VLSI-ASIC-RISCV-Portfolio
 This project details the successful Very Large Scale Integration  (VLSI) implementation of the RV32E201X, a custom 32-bit RISC-V processor  core. The design employs a classic 5-stage pipeline architecture (Fetch, Decode,  Execute, Memory Access, Write-Back) to maximize instruction throughput and  overall performance.
